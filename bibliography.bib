  abstract="OMNeT++ (www.omnetpp.org) is an extensible, modular, component-based C++ simulation library and framework which also includes an integrated development and a graphical runtime environment. Domain-specific functionality (support for simulation of communication networks, queuing networks, performance evaluation, etc.) is provided by model frameworks, developed as independent projects. There are extensions for real-time simulation, network emulation, support for alternative programming languages (Java, C{\#}), database integration, SystemC integration, HLA and several other functions.",
